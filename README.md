### Hello World! 

My name is Kenyon aka Intrahype. This repository will serve as my personal portfolio for software engineering.  I will be loading this space with examples of my work in Python and Assembly, as well as Scripting (multiple languages).  

This portfolio is hosted on both [github](https://github.com/intrahype/portfolio) and [tangled](https://tangled.org/intrahype.net/portfolio)
